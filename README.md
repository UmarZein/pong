2. Install python virtual environment and activate it (everytime you want to run the game, you should activate the virtual environment)
```
C:\your\desired\directory\pong>python -m venv venv
```
If something goes wrong, this might fix it:
```
C:\your\desired\directory\pong>python3.8 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment
```
C:\your\desired\directory\pong>venv\scripts\activate
```
On linux,
```
$ ~/.../pong source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```
(venv) C:\your\desired\directory\pong>pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Start server, if you're hosting
```
(venv) C:\your\desired\directory\pong>python server.py
pygame 2.0.1 (SDL 2.0.14, Python 3.8.10)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
port:5555
ip:port = 192.168.0.0:5555
```
5. Join server, if you're not
```
(venv) C:\your\desired\directory\pong>python client.py
